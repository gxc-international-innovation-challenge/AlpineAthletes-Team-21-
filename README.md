The creation of this github repository was part of the GlobalXchanges/Challenges (GXC) Internationel Virtual Innovation program of HM Hochschule MÃ¼nchen University of Applied Sciences.

The goal of this program is to educate global citizens by connecting students from 8 different countries and varying course of studies. Participating students will be split up into teams of 4-5 people and work on an assigned real life project proposed by one of 3 challenge-givers. In this evironmant students learn to work remotly in an international and intercultural project using digital skills and technologies to prototype a solution for the challenge.

This environment helps students acquiring an entrepreneurial mindset while also improving their teamwork, communication and presentation skills.

# The Challenge:

### The Challenge-givers

The challenge-giver in our case was the german-ski-federation and Mr. Klaus Rambach, the federation's head of strategic developement.
Our endeavours throughout the duration of this course where dedicated to create a soultion specifically for them based on their needs, feedback and most importantly the challenge-statement they were proposing.

### Challenge-statement:

How could we digitally connect/engage ski enthusiasts in a way that adds value to all stakeholders and leads to an active/interconnected ski community?

# The Solution:

### Inspiration:

We were inspired by the American football fantasy league, a popular game among football fans with about 59 million users across the USA and Canada.
So we created a "winter sports fantasy league" for the German Ski Federation and the german ski-community.

### Prototype:

Our solution takes form in an app called "AlpineAthletes". It's main feature is the virtual league where users can, similary to fantasy football, draft athletes and create their own leagues while competing with their friends or other users. While playing the league, users can earn points depending on their placements and use them to aquire special discounts. Furthermore the app includes a results- and event-feature with which users can get information on tournaments results and upcoming events in a quick and easy way.

### Virtual League:

Inspired by the American Fantasy Football league, a 7 billion dollar industry with 59 million participants, AlpineAthletes app users have the opportunity to make their dream team of athletes from 6 winter sports through the fantasy winter sports league game feature. Once the winter sports season has begun, the game officially begins. The higher the athlete on their team places in real life events, the more points the user gets. At the end of the winter sports season, the user that earns the most points within their league, can use them in the Discount Shop.

### Discount Shop:

With the points earnied in the virtual league, users can aquire different discounts for gear, lift tickets or event tickets. While each discount costs a certain amount of points, the more valuable a discount is, the more points will be needed. Once a user decides to use their points for a discount, the app will finish the "transaction" by generating a unique discount code, which can be used in the online-shop of the specific brand or resort.

### Results Feature:

The results feature allows you to look at the results from all of the different winter sports events and the results are powered by FIS.  The user can access results for Men's, Women's and Nation's events.

### Events Feature:

The events feature allows users to see all upcoming winter sports events surrounding the World Cup with the opportunity to purchase tickets for the event through the app.  The user can see all event details such as where, when, and what type of event it is.
