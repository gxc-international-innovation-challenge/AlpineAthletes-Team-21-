The creation of this github repository was part of the GlobalXchanges/Challenges (GXC) Internationel Virtual Innovation program of HM Hochschule MÃ¼nchen University of Applied Sciences.

The goal of this program is to educate global citizens by connecting students from 8 different countries and varying course of studies. Participating students will be split up into teams of 4-5 people and work on an assigned real life project proposed by one of 3 challenge-givers. In this evironmant students learn to work remotly in an international and intercultural project using digital skills and technologies to prototype a solution for the challenge.

This environment helps students acquiring an entrepreneurial mindset while also improving their teamwork, communication and presentation skills.
